# Running audioMotion in a browser

?> Your **Presets, Playlists** and **Custom gradients** are saved to your browser's local storage and will only be accessible in the
browser they were saved, using the same [server port](server.md).

* The [PIP button](users-manual.md#top-panel-buttons) will be disabled on browsers that don't support the Picture-In-Picture API

## Microphone input

Please note that browser access to the microphone is only allowed in a secure context, i.e., a page acessed via HTTPS protocol,
or from *localhost* or a local HTML file (file://).

If your sound card supports *Stereo mix* mode, this option may be listed as an input device when you set the Source to MIC.
The *Stereo mix* input allows audioMotion to read audio generated by any program running in your PC.

## Playlists

Saved playlists appear in the playlist selection box.

Select a playlist and click one of the buttons:

| Button | Action |
|:-------|:-------|
| **Load** | Load the selected playlist, **adding** its contents to the end of the current queue |
| **Save** | Update the selected playlist with the current queue contents |
| **Delete** | Permanently delete the selected playlist |
