# User Interface

![screenshot1](img/screenshot1.png "audioMotion.js user interface")

## Main controls

### Source

![ui-source](img/UI_source.png)

Select the **MIC** position to visualize audio from your microphone instead of the music player.
When MIC is selected, the [volume](#volume) will be automatically turned all the way down, to prevent feedback loops from the speakers.
If you're using headphones, increase the volume to listen to the microphone audio.

> Please note that microphone access is only allowed in a secure context, i.e., if you're accessing audioMotion on *localhost*, via local file (open index.html directly) or HTTPS protocol.

If your sound card supports *Stereo mix* mode, this option may be listed as an input device when access to your microphone is requested.
The *Stereo mix* input allows audioMotion to read audio generated by any program running in your PC.

### Player controls

![ui-player](img/UI_player.png)

Use the player controls to play, pause and skip through queued songs.

**Hold** the ![ui-player-previous](img/UI_player_previous.png "previous") or ![ui-player-next](img/UI_player_next.png "next") buttons to rewind or fast-forward the current song.

The **Stop** button stops playback and resets the queue pointer to the first song.

Click the ![ui-player-shuffle](img/UI_player_shuffle.png "shuffle") button to shuffle the queued songs and start playing.

When the ![ui-player-repeat](img/UI_player_repeat.png "repeat") switch is active, the queue will be played on loop.

### Volume

![ui-volume](img/UI_volume.png)

Hover the mouse over the volume button and use the mouse wheel to turn the volume up or down.

Volume can also be adjusted with the **Up** and **Down** arrow keys.

## File explorer and play queue

![files-panel](img/files-panel.png)

The file explorer allows you to navigate through the music folder shared by the server.

> Supported extensions are flac, m4a, mp3, ogg and wav for music files, and m3u or m3u8 for playlists. Codec support may vary, depending on your web browser and operating system.

> Any image file found in the current folder will be shown in the background of the file explorer, giving preference to filenames containing the words *cover*, *folder* or *front* (in this order).

Double-click a music or playlist file to quickly add it to the queue. Hold *Ctrl* to select multiple files, or *Shift* to select a range of files.

You can drag and drop files from the file explorer into the play queue, or click the **Add selected** button to add selected files to the queue, or the **Add all files** button to enqueue all music files in the current folder.

The **Upload file** lets you play any music file from your computer, even if it's not in the shared folder. Uploaded files can't be added to queue or saved to playlists, though.

You can also load a remote file from an URL, using the **Add from URL** button.

Double-click a song in the play queue to play it.

You can drag and drop queued songs to reorder them. Hold *Ctrl* to select multiple files, or *Shift* to select a range.
Press *Delete* (*Backspace* on Mac) to remove selected songs from the queue.

**Clear** clears the queue. **Save as...** saves the queue as a new local playlist, stored in your browser's local storage.

Saved playlists appear in the playlist selection box. Select a playlist and click the ![folder-button](img/folder-button.png "folder") button to load it into the queue.
Press the ![disk-button](img/save-button.png "floppy disk") button to update the selected playlist with the current queue contents.
Press the ![trash-button](img/trash-button.png "trashcan") button to permanently deleted the selected playlist.


## Settings Panel

![settings-panel](img/settings-panel.png)

### Mode

![ui-mode](img/UI_mode.png)

Selects the visualization mode.

+ **Discrete frequencies** mode allows you to visualize individual frequencies provided by the [FFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform);
+ **Area graph** displays the same frequency data as above, but as a filled area graph;
+ **Line graph** connects all the discrete frequency points in a continuous line and allows you to customize the [line width and fill opacity](#line-width-and-fill-opacity);
+ **Octave bands** modes display wider vertical bars, each one representing the *n*th part of an octave, based on a [24-tone equal tempered scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarter_tone).

You can also select the visualization mode using the **M** and **Shift + M** keyboard shortcuts.

### Random Mode

![ui-random-mode](img/UI_random_mode.png)

The visualization mode and some other settings may be randomized on track change or time interval.

If the [AUTO](#gradient) Gradient switch is active, a random gradient will be selected on every mode change.
You can choose which other settings may be changed by random mode in the [Config panel](#config-panel).

### Bar spacing

![ui-bar-spacing](img/UI_bar_spacing.png)

Bar Spacing can be configured when any [octave bands mode](#mode) is selected. Avaliable options are:

+ Legacy (minimum spacing between analyzer bars);
+ Narrow (10% of bar width) (default);
+ Regular (25% of bar width);
+ Wide (50% of bar width);
+ Extra wide (75% of bar width).

### Line Width and Fill Opacity

![ui-line-width](img/UI_line_width.png)
![ui-fill-opacity](img/UI_fill_opacity.png)

These settings are effective only when [Line graph mode](#mode) is selected.

**Line Width** controls the thickness of the graph line, while **Fill Opacity** adjusts the transparency of the graph area.

ðŸš§ On Firefox, Fill Opacity may not work properly with [RADIAL](#mode-switches) mode, due to [this bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1164912).

### Gradient

![ui-gradient](img/UI_gradient.png)

Several options of color gradients for the analyzer graphs. You can also change gradients using the **G** and **Shift + G** keyboard shortcuts.

If the **AUTO** switch is on, the **next gradient** will be selected on each track change.
When [Random mode](#random-mode) is active and the **AUTO** switch is on, a **random gradient** will be selected on each mode change.

The **SPLIT** switch determines how the gradient is applied when [Stereo](#stereo) is active.
If **SPLIT** is on, the gradient will be split between both channels, so each channel will have different colors; otherwise, both channels will use the full gradient (this is the default).

### Effects

![ui-effects](img/UI_effects.png)

Select additional visualization effects for **octave bands modes only.**

+ **LEDS** toggles the vintage LED effect for the analyzer bars
+ **LUMI** toggles the luminance bars effect - analyzer bars are displayed always at full-height, varying their luminance instead

### Radial

![ui-radial](img/UI_radial.png)

If the **RADIAL** switch is on, the spectrum analyzer is displayed as a circle with radial frequencies. **This mode disables both LEDS and LUMI effects.**

You can also toggle radial mode using the **C** keyboard shortcut.

The **SPIN** slider allows you to configure the analyzer spinning speed, when in radial mode.

### Background

![ui-background](img/UI_background.png)

Selects the analyzer background.

- **Gradient default** uses the background color defined by the currently selected gradient - when the [LED effect](#mode-switches) is on, this shows the "unlit" LEDs instead;
- **Black** uses a black background;
- **Album cover** displays the album cover for the current song. See also [Image Fit](#image-fit) and [Image Dim](#image-dim) settings.

You can cycle through the available options using the **B** keyboard shortcut.

Album covers are preferably retrieved from song metadata. When a picture is not found in the metadata, **audioMotion** will look for jpg, png, gif or bmp files
in the song's folder, and will use any image which filename contains the words *cover*, *folder* or *front* (in this order), or the first image found otherwise.

### Image Fit

![ui-image-fit](img/UI_image_fit.png)

When [Background](#background) is set to **Album cover**, this option selects the size and positioning of the image.

- **Adjust** - resizes the image so it fills the entire canvas;
- **Center** - displays the image horizontally centered on the canvas (default);
- **Pulse** - makes the image pulsate to the beat of the song;
- **Repeat** - repeats the image horizontally to fill the canvas;
- **Zoom In** - image is initially centered on the canvas and slowly zooms in as the song plays;
- **Zoom Out** - image is initially enlarged at 200% and slowly zooms out as the song plays.

You can cycle through the available options using the **Shift + B** keyboard shortcut.

### Image Dim

![ui-image-dim](img/UI_image_dim.png)

When [Background](#background) is set to **Album cover**, this option adjusts the brightness of the background image.

### Reflex

![ui-reflex](img/UI_reflex.png)

Selects a reflection style for the analyzer. This setting has no effect when the [LUMI](#mode-switches) switch is active.

### Sensitivity

![ui-sensitivity](img/UI_sensitivity.png)

Adjusts the analyzer sensitivity to improve the visualization of songs too quiet or too loud. You can also use the **N** and **Shift + N** keyboard shortcuts.

The presets can be customized in the [Config Panel](#config-panel).

### Frequency Range

![ui-frequency-range](img/UI_frequency_range.png)

The lowest and highest frequencies you want to see in the graphic spectrum analyzer. You can use this feature to "zoom in" a specific frequency range.

### FFT Size

![ui-fftsize](img/UI_fftsize.png)

Number of samples used for the [Fast Fourier Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform) performed by the analyzer.

Higher values provide greater detail in the frequency domain (especially for low frequencies), but less detail in the time domain (slower response to changes),
so you may also want to adjust the [Smoothing](#smoothing) if changing this.

### Smoothing

![ui-smoothing](img/UI_smoothing.png)

Average constant used to smooth values between analysis frames.

Lower values make the analyzer react faster to changes, and may look better with faster tempo songs and/or larger [FFT sizes](#fft-size).
Increase it if the animation looks too "jumpy".

### Analyzer switches

![ui-switches](img/UI_switches.png)

+ **SCALEX** displays the frequency (Hz) scale on the horizontal axis
+ **SCALEY** displays the level (dB) scale on the vertical axis
+ **INFO** toggles the on-screen display of song information on every track change
+ **PEAKS** shows amplitude peaks for each frequency
+ **FLAT** applies an outline instead of shadow on text displayed on canvas - may improve performance, depending on your graphic card and browser
+ **LO-RES** reduces canvas resolution to improve rendering speed (especially useful for 4K+ displays)
+ **STEREO** toggles stereo (dual channel) analyzer, with left channel graph at the top and right channel at the bottom
+ **FPS** displays current framerate at the top right corner

The underlined character in each switch label indicates its keyboard shortcut, when available.

### Preset

![ui-preset](img/UI_preset.png)

The **Demo** preset will pick new visualization settings when loaded and will set random mode to 15 seconds, so it's a great way to quickly overview all of audioMotion's features!

**Full resolution**, **LED bars** and **Octave bands** presets provide quick configuration recommendations.

Any changes to the settings will be automatically saved to your browser's [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)
and restored the next time you open audioMotion. You can manually load the **Last session** preset to undo any changes made during the current session.

The **Restore defaults** preset resets all options to their initial values, as in the first time you run audioMotion.

Save a favorite configuration in the **Custom** preset, by clicking the **Save** button.


## Console

![console](img/console.png)

The console records several useful information, like audio and video settings, configuration changes and error messages.


## Config Panel

![config-panel](img/config-panel.png)

### Enabled Modes
