♪♫ **See** your music with **audioMotion**! ♪♫

**audioMotion.js** is a high-resolution real-time audio spectrum analyzer and full-featured music player written in JavaScript.

## Features

* High-resolution (retina / HiDPI ready) real-time audio spectrum analyzer
* Fullscreen support at up to 60 frames per second
* Logarithmic frequency scale with customizable range
* Visualize discrete frequencies, or octave bands based on the equal tempered scale
* Several color gradients with optional vintage LED effect
* Customizable Web Audio API parameters (FFT size, sensitivity and time-smoothing)
* HTML5 audio player for MP3, AAC (M4A), OGG and FLAC files (codec support may vary depending on browser and operating system)
* Visual file explorer and play queue with drag-and-drop functionality
* Support for M3U playlists (`m3u` and `m3u8` file extensions)
* Visualize audio from your microphone (or "stereo mix", if your soundcard supports it)
* Lightweight custom file server — also works on standard web servers with minimal configuration
* Client runs on any modern browser (tested with Firefox, Chrome and Safari)

## Online demo

https://hvianna.github.io/audioMotion.js/

The demo allows you to play songs from your PC and use the microphone input. File explorer and play queue are not available, since there are no media files hosted on that server.

## Quick start

Download the latest version from the [releases page](https://github.com/hvianna/audioMotion.js/releases/latest). Portable binaries are available for Windows, Linux and macOS.

Launch audioMotion and you'll be asked for the path to your music folder. Only files under that folder will be accessible to the player.

You can also use the command line argument `-m` to set the music folder when launching audioMotion:

```
audioMotion -m c:\users\john\music
```

This will start the server and should also launch the client in your browser.

The complete command line options are:

```
-m <path> : path to music directory
-p <port> : change server listening port (default is 8000)
-s        : start server only (do not launch client)
-e        : allow external connections (by default, only localhost)
```
